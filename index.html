                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young 
                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s 
                appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
                particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he 
                discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
                A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could 
                have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a 
                repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
                of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the 
                heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, 
                warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the 
                wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but 
                would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of 
                the page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers 
                reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and 
                that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked 
                right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic 
                time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led 
                by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
                Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-
                called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being 
                wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a 
                trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought 
                smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his 
                colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

            <p>
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though 
                many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <p>
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in 
                science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing 
                the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast 
                realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see
                , extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of 
                billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos 
                whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, 
                beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of 
                other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta 
                water boiling over.
